 <p class="gradient-text">Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit this site. I built this domain hoping to create a repertoire of my projects <br> 
  and development as a software engineer as well as my development as an individual.<br><br>
  
  My name is Sergio Nogueira Jr., I am a novice-mid level Full-Stack Software Engineer graduating in May 2022. I interned for two<br>
  years in the protein industry as both an IT Intern as well as a .NET Framework Intern, developing applied programming skills early on in my undergrad.<br>
  I was born in Brazil and immigrated to the U.S. at an early age, retaining my fluency of Portuguese, English, and Spanish. <br><br>

  I am a passionate individual and love to code!<br>
  From an early age I admired the creativity in programming: whether it be front-end, back-end, data analysis, <br>
  the idea that I could program a robot to life, create a website, a game, or whatever I desired - was an incredibly inspiring realization. <br>
  I found myself latched to the computer by the age of 12, and marveled at how every bit of software on my computer evolved so quickly. <br><br>

  Whenever I am not on the computer, you will find me cooking, exercising, watching the UFC, traveling, or with friends! <br>
  I am also business-oriented, and plan to learn as much as possible before beginning my entrepreneurial path. <br>
  
  Everything that I do I aim to do well, and hopefully the visual appeal of this little website is a testament to that. <br>
  If you would like to see my code for this website, <a href="https://github.com/sergionjr/sergionjr.github.io">please click here.</a>
